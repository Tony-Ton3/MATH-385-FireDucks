    "### 1. Import Hook (For Existing Projects)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Automatic DataFrame Optimization\n",

    "- Reduces redundant operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Expert-Level Optimizations\n",

    "- Uses column-oriented processing\n",
    "- Optimizes data access patterns\n",

    "> **Key Advantage:** Think of FireDucks like a chess grandmaster - while pandas makes each move immediately, FireDucks plans the entire game ahead of time. This planning allows it to find the most efficient way to execute your data operations, just like how a chess player can think several moves ahead to find the best strategy!"
