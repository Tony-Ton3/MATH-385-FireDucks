    "\n",
    "1. **Massive Speedup**\n",
    "   - Dramatically faster data processing\n",
    "   - Optimized execution model\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **100% Compatibility with Existing Pandas Code**\n",
    "   - Works with all pandas operations\n",
    "   - No need to learn new syntax\n",

    "## Two Ways to Use FireDucks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Import Hook (For Existing Projects)\n",
    "Perfect for existing pandas projects - no code changes needed! FireDucks will automatically replace all pandas imports with its own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Terminal/Python Scripts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python3 -m fireducks.pandas your_script.py\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "    %load_ext fireducks.pandas\n",
    "    import pandas as pd    \n",
    "\n",
    ">  **Note:** use import hooks for existing program as your program may include files that imports pandas that is deeply nested\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Explicit Import (For New Projects)\n",
    "For new projects, you can directly import FireDucks instead of pandas. This is the most straightforward approach when starting fresh.\n",
    "\n",
    "    import fireducks.pandas as pd"
